        <h3>First law of thermodynamics</h3>
        <p>The first law of thermodynamics is simply the general law of conservation of energy applied to any system. According to this law, “the total heat energy change in any system is the sum of the internal energy change and the work done.”
            When a certain quantity of heat dQ is subjected to a system, a part of it is used in increasing the internal energy by dU and a part is used in performing external work dW, hence
            <br>
            dQ = dU + dW
            <br>
            For gases, the specific heat capacity depends on the process or the conditions under which heat capacity transfer takes place. There are mainly two principal specific heat capacities for a gas. These are specific heat capacity at constant volume and specific heat capacity at constant pressure.</li>
            From First Law of Thermodynamics we find a relation between two principal specific heats of an ideal gas. According to the relation
            <br>
            Cp-Cυ = R
            <br>
            Here Cp and Cυ are molar specific heats under constant pressure and constant volume condition respectively.</p>

        <h3>Diagonal Relationship in s block</h3>
        <p>A diagonal relationship in S block elements exists between adjacent elements which are located in the second and third period of the periodic table. For example, Lithium of group 1A and second period shows similarities with the properties of magnesium which are located in the 2nd group and 3rd period.
        Similarly, properties of beryllium which are located in the 2nd group and 2nd period show a likeness with properties of aluminium which is located in the third period and third group. The two elements which show similarities in their properties can be called a diagonal pair or diagonal neighbours.</p>

        <h3>Permutations and Combinations</h3>
        <p>
            The formula for permutation is given by:
            nPr = (n!)/(n-r)!
            where n is the number of different elements
            r is the arrangement pattern of the element
            Both r and n are positive integers.
           <br>
            The formula for combination is given by:
            nCr = (n!) /[r! (n-r)!]</p>
